# Overview of this project

I created this project as a self-study and practice of JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, API requests, and website development. All movie data is fetched from the TMDB API. The website is designed to resemble Netflix.


# Project details

- **"Home" tab**

This tab fetches and displays the top 20 most popular movies from the API. Additionally, it lists all available movie genres and displays related movies for each genre. This page does not include a filtering function but organizes movies by genre for easy browsing.

- **"Genre Search" tab**

This page allows users to select a movie genre, and the system fetches and displays the corresponding films.

- **"Title Search" tab**

This page enables users to filter films by movie title.

- **"Bookmark" tab**

Users can view detailed movie information by clicking on a movie to open its modal. They can also bookmark movies, and this tab displays all bookmarked movies, allowing users to view and remove them as needed.
